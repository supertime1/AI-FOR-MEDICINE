# AI for Medical Treatment

## Week 1: Treatment Effect Estimation
### 1. Randomized control trials
- Absolute risk reduction (ARR): 1/ARR is Number Needed to Treat (NNT) which is number of patients needed to be treat in order to benefit one of them
- Randomized control trials
### 2. Average treatment effect (ATE) 
- In a randomized control trials, ATE can be esitmated from two randmized groups instead of based on every patient to take both treatment and no-treatment, which is often very hard to do in a clinical trial

### 3. Individualized treatment effect


## Week 2: Medical Question Answering
### 1. Question Answering
- Absolute risk reduction (ARR): 1/ARR is Number Needed to Treat (NNT) which is number of patients needed to be treat in order to benefit one of them
- Randomized control trials
### 2. Automatic Labeling 
- In a randomized control trials, ATE can be esitmated from two randmized groups instead of based on every patient to take both treatment and no-treatment, which is often very hard to do in a clinical trial

### 3. Evaluate Automatic labeling


## Week 3: ML Interpretation
### 1. Feature Importance
- Drop column method
- Permutation method
### 2. Individual Feature Importance
- Individual feature importance
### 3. Interpreting Deep Learning Models
