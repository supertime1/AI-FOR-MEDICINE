# AI for Medical Prognosis

## Week 1: Linear Prognostic Models
### 1. Prognostic models in medical practice
  - Afib: for patients with Afib, what is 1-year risk of stroke
  - Liver Disease Mortality: for patients >=12 on liver transplant waiting lists, provides estimate of 3-month mortality for patients
  - Risk of heart disease: For patients 20 or older who do not already have heart disease. what's 10-year risk of heart disease
  
### 2. Prognostic Model Evalution: 

- Concordant paris (CP): actual outcome and risk score agrees
- Risk ties (RT): actual outcome is the same
- Permissible paris (PP): actual outcome and risk score disagrees
- C-index = (CP + 0.5 * RT)/PP


## Week 2: Tree-based Models
### 1. Decision Tree
### 2. Identify Missing Data 
- Missing completely at random: missingness not dependent on anything
- Missing at random: missingness dependent only on available information (e.g. age)
- Missing not at random: missingness dependent on unavailable information (e.g. if the waiting line is long, donâ€™t do BP test)


### 3. Imputation to Handle Missing Data
- Mean imputation
- Regression Imputation

  
## Week 3: Survival Models and Time
### 1. Survival Estimates
- Difference to Risk Model:
  - risk model: what is the probability of death in 5 years = Pr
  - survival model: what is the probability of survival past 5 years = 1 - Pr
- Survival function: what is the probability of survival past any time t?
  - S(t) = Pr(T>t)
  - S(u) <= S(v) if u >= v
  - S(t) = 1 if t = 0, and S(t) = 0 if t = +infinite
  
  
### 2. Time to Event Data (Surival data)
- Y is time to event, instead of 0 or 1 in risk model
- Right Censoring: event always after, if any
  - end of study censoring
  - loss-to-follow-up censoring
- Left Censoring: event happened before a cetain time, but don't know when exactly

### 3. Estimate Survival with Censored Data
- Use chain rule of conditional probability: P(A,B,C) = P(A|B,C) x P(B|C) x P(C)
  - S(25) = P(T>=26,T>=25,...,T>=0) = P(T>=26|T>=25) x P(T>=25|T>=24) x ... P(T>=1|T>=0) x P(T>=0) = (1 - Pr(T=25|T>=25))...(1-P(T=0|T>=0))
  - In general, Kaplan Meier Estimate: S(t) = PI(1- d(i)/n(i))

## Week 4: Build a risk model using linear and tree-based models
### 1. Suvival and hazard functions
- Survival to Hazard: what is the probability of survival past any time t -> what's a patient's immediate risk of death if they make it to time t
